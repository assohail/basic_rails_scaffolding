# Scaffolding With Rails

Welcome to Ajmal's Rails App! ðŸš€ This simple Rails application was generated with a scaffold to manage information about Ajmal, including mobile numbers and foozbol preferences.

## Getting Started

To get started with this application, follow these steps:

 ```bash
 git clone git@github.com:assohail/basic_rails_scaffolding.git
 cd ajmals-rails-app
 ```
 ðŸ”„ Change the default db name (if you want) and credentials

 ```
 rails db:create
 rails db:migrate
 rails s
 ```

- You can now visit [http://localhost:3000/ajmals](http://localhost:3000/ajmals) in your browser to interact with the application.

- **Create:** Add new entries with mobile numbers and foozbol preferences.
- **Read:** View the list of Ajmal's entries and details.
